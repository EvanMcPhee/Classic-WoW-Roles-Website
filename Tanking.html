                <br>
                <p> As a tank your job is to protect your teammates from taking damage. 
                You are up front with the bad guys in close range combat keeping their attention on you (keeping threat) so your healers only have one person to worry about. 
                Tanks focus on keeping threat and mitigating damage towards them. Keep in mind there are usually only 4 or 5 tanks in a raid but for the most part they are in high demand.
