                <h2>About<br></h2>
                <p>World of Warcraft Classic is a remaster of the original online role playing game World of Warcraft (WoW) created by Blizzard in 2004. 
                Since I have really been enjoying the game lately and probably spend too much time playing it, 
                I thought I would make a quick guide to the different roles your character can perform in the game and what classes fit each role. </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are three roles your character can perform in World of Warcraft and each is valuable and required if you want to see all the game has to offer but in this guide we will focus on raiding (10-40 players). 
                The roles you can choose to play are Tank, Healer, or Damage but keep in mind not all classes you can choose from can perform all 3 roles 
                so use the navigation bar above to check out a role and see the classes that can perform it. </p>
                <br>
                Here's a picture of my first time beating the raid Black Wing Lair.
