                <p>Healers cast spells to refill the health point of all players in the raid and when things go bad they can also bring players back to life.
                For the most part healers are also responsible for providing buffs to increase players stats and some can cast spells to help mitigate damage. 
                Each raid usually has around 10 healers and each raid aims to have at least one of every healing class they can.</p>
