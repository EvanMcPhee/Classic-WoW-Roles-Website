                <p>Every class in the game can play the role of a damage dealer but there are some that are widely considered better then others. 
                The below table lists if a class is ranged or melee combat type and some more information on the class itself. 
                In most raid groups there will be a pretty even split of ranged and melee damage classes usually leaning more on melee.</p>
